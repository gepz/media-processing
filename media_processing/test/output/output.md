**Speaker Notes:**

"Welcome to our presentation on leveraging conversational AI for public health interventions. As we all know, technology has become an essential tool in monitoring populations for public health understanding and intervention. In the HCI and CSCW communities, various systems have been proposed and examined to support public health monitoring and intervention at scale. However, advances in AI and NLP technologies have opened up new avenues for supporting population-level health interventions.

One such area is the use of large language models (LLMs) to develop open-domain dialog systems that can provide empathetic interactions. These systems have the potential to provide informational and emotional support to populations going through difficult health experiences. However, few studies have explored the benefits and drawbacks of LLM-based chatbots in real-world public health settings.

To address this knowledge gap, we present the case of CLOVA CareCall, a conversational AI that aims to support socially isolated individuals via check-up phone calls as a public health intervention. We conducted focus group workshops with 14 CareCall users and interviewed 20 stakeholders, including users, teleoperators, and developers. Our findings highlight the benefits and challenges of leveraging LLM-driven chatbots in public health interventions.

We will discuss the benefits of LLM-driven chatbots, including their ability to provide a holistic understanding of individuals and offload workload for teleoperators. However, we also highlight the challenges, including the need for customization, the burden on teleoperators, and the limitations of LLMs in providing emotional support.

Our study provides insights into the role of LLM-driven chatbots in public health intervention and highlights the need for designing resources and processes that help different stakeholders negotiate the tradeoffs between open-domain and task-oriented chatbots. We also discuss the need and challenges in scaling LLM-driven chatbots to support diverse public health needs."

**Slide Page Title:** Challenges and Opportunities in Leveraging LLM-Driven Chatbots in Public Health Interventions

**Bullet Points:**

- The municipal authorities faced challenges in customizing LLM-based chatbots to meet specific health needs due to uncertainty in control and resource-intensive nature.
- Users expected the system to support social services out of its scope, placing a burden on teleoperators.
- LLM-driven chatbots struggled to provide emotional support due to limited personalization and lack of long-term memory.
- The open-ended nature of conversations led to tensions around managing expectations around emergency and social service needs.
- Municipal authorities wanted to integrate specific health monitoring questions or customize to different target groups, but this was hard to meet due to inherent characteristics of LLM-driven chatbots.

**Speaker Notes:**

"Today, we're going to discuss the challenges and opportunities in leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-driven chatbots in public health interventions. Our research highlights the benefits and challenges of using LLM-driven chatbots in public health, particularly in the context of the CareCall system. While CareCall offered emotional benefits, it also had limitations in providing emotional support due to its limited personalization and lack of long-term memory.

We observed tensions around the open-ended nature of LLM-driven chatbots, which made it challenging for the developers to manage expectations around emergency and social service needs of the users. Additionally, municipal authorities wanted to integrate specific health monitoring questions or customize to different target groups, but this was hard to meet due to inherent characteristics of LLM-driven chatbots.

Our findings have implications for further research and implementation of chatbots for public health interventions. We suggest the need for designing resources and processes that help communicate the respective strengths and weaknesses of task-oriented and open-domain chatbots to help multiple stakeholders in public health contexts negotiate those tradeoffs. We also discuss the need and challenges in scaling LLM-driven chatbots to support diverse public health needs. By understanding these challenges and opportunities, we can improve the design and implementation of LLM-driven chatbots in public health interventions."

**Slide Title:** "Caregiving Technology for Individuals Living Alone: Challenges and Opportunities"

**Bullet Points:**

* Individuals living alone are vulnerable to health concerns, social isolation, and loneliness
* Caregiving technologies aim to support these individuals, including telecare systems and systems that use environmental sensors and ambient displays
* Existing technologies often target individuals with readily accessible social contacts, neglecting those with fewer social contacts, such as low-SES individuals
* Low-SES individuals living alone face unique challenges in emergency situations due to limited social contacts
* New advances in AI offer opportunities to facilitate at-scale health interventions for vulnerable populations

**Speaker Notes:**

"Good morning everyone, today we're going to discuss the challenges and opportunities of caregiving technology for individuals living alone. As we age, living alone can increase our risk of social isolation and loneliness, which can have serious negative health outcomes. Caregiving technologies aim to address these issues, but existing systems often focus on individuals with readily accessible social contacts, leaving behind those with fewer connections, such as low-SES individuals. This is a critical gap in our current approach. However, new advances in AI offer a promising solution, enabling us to automate some aspects of care and reach out to broader populations who have been underserved. Our research aims to explore the benefits and challenges of deploying AI-driven check-up calls with low-SES individuals living alone."

**Slide Page Title:** "Large Language Models: A New Paradigm in NLP"

**Bullet Points:**

* Language models aim to generate coherent follow-up text to inputs, trained on human-generated textual data
* Pre-trained models can be retargeted to specific NLP tasks through fine-tuning with task-specific datasets
* Recent large language models have enabled a new paradigm of in-context learning
* In-context learning allows models to understand input text and generate coherent follow-up text
* LLMs can be leveraged in various problem spaces, including creative writing, information extraction, and writing programming code

**Speaker Notes:**

"Welcome to the topic of large language models. In this section, we'll explore the advancements in language models and their applications in NLP. Language models have made remarkable progress in recent years, and their ability to generate coherent follow-up text to inputs has opened up new possibilities in NLP.

One of the key features of language models is their ability to be retargeted to specific NLP tasks through fine-tuning with task-specific datasets. This has enabled the development of pre-trained models that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks, from machine translation to sentiment classification.

However, recent large language models have taken this a step further by enabling a new paradigm of in-context learning. In this paradigm, models understand input text written in human language and generate coherent follow-up text that follows the input prompt. This has enabled the development of applications such as creative writing, information extraction, and writing programming code.

Our work focuses on the application of LLMs in open-domain dialog systems. We'll explore the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this context and discuss the potential applications and future directions of this research."

**Slide Title:** "Challenges in Designing Open-Ended Conversational AIs"

**Bullet Points:**

* Task-oriented vs. open-domain dialog systems
	+ Task-oriented: designed for specific goals with pre-defined information schema
	+ Open-domain: free-form conversations on various topics
* Challenges in designing open-domain dialog systems
	+ Difficulty in defining quality metrics
	+ Complexity of multi-turn reasoning and emotional interaction
	+ Limited research on LLM-driven chatbots
* Limitations of LLMs in chatbots
	+ Lack of explainability
	+ Risk of unintended conversation flows
	+ Possibility of biased or toxic output

**Speaker Notes:**

"Welcome to the challenges of designing open-ended conversational AIs. While task-oriented dialog systems are designed for specific goals with pre-defined information schema, open-domain dialog systems aim to have free-form conversations on various topics. However, designing open-domain dialog systems is more challenging due to the difficulty in defining quality metrics, complexity of multi-turn reasoning, and emotional interaction.

Recent advances in LLMs have brought breakthroughs in open-domain dialog systems, but there are still limitations and challenges. LLMs lack explainability, which makes it difficult to anticipate how they process the dialog history and generate responses. There is also a risk of unintended conversation flows and the possibility of biased or toxic output.

To steer the conversations towards desired scenarios, researchers have used in-context learning approaches, but it's still challenging to perfectly control the model's output. We need to be aware of these challenges and limitations when designing LLM-driven chatbots to ensure they are safe and effective for users."

**Slide Title:** "Challenges and Risks of Leveraging LLMs for Open-Ended Chatbots"

**Bullet Points:**

* LLMs may provide more negative comments than human therapists
* Pre-trained models may expose socially biased or toxic language
* In-context learning approach can steer conversations, but controlling model output is challenging
* Risks of leveraging LLMs for open-ended chatbots include:
	+ Unintended negative comments
	+ Socially biased or toxic language
	+ Difficulty controlling model output

**Speaker Notes:**

"Today, I'd like to highlight some of the challenges and risks associated with using Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended chatbots.

**Slide Title:** "Motivation and Deployment of CareCall"

**Bullet Points:**

* CareCall is a conversational AI system designed for socially isolated individuals in South Korea
* Motivated by the Act on the Prevention and Management of Lonely Death in South Korea
* CareCall provides emotional support and regularly checks users' health status
* System architecture includes a chatbot, dashboard, and teleoperators
* CareCall was first deployed in Haeundae-gu in Busan in November 2021 and expanded to 20 municipalities in South Korea by May 2022
* In Seoul, CareCall was deployed to 301 individuals from June 2022 to August 2022 as part of a pilot project

**Speaker Notes:**

"Good morning everyone, let's move on to the motivation and deployment of CareCall. As we discussed earlier, CareCall is a conversational AI system designed to support socially isolated individuals in South Korea. The system was motivated by the Act on the Prevention and Management of Lonely Death in South Korea, which aimed to address the issue of lonely deaths in the country.

CareCall's system architecture includes a chatbot that regularly calls users and leads open-ended conversations, a dashboard that extracts health metrics and emergency alerts from the conversations, and teleoperators who monitor the call recordings and health metrics.

The CareCall pilot project was first launched in Haeundae-gu in Busan in November 2021 and expanded to 20 municipalities in South Korea by May 2022. In Seoul, the project was deployed to 301 individuals from June 2022 to August 2022 as part of a pilot project.

The deployment of CareCall in Seoul targeted middle-aged adults living alone, who were predominantly recipients of the National Basic Livelihood Security. The project participants were recommended by public officers who were providing social care services to these individuals. The introduction of CareCall did not replace their existing check-up calls from humans but rather increased the frequency of check-up calls.

Each municipality's government handled the teleoperating task of CareCall in different ways, with some hiring part-time workers and others using social welfare officers. In Seoul, the government hired 14 part-time social workers through a social enterprise that employs retired individuals over the age of 55. These teleoperators monitored the call recordings for negative health signals or emergency alerts and shared their findings with their team and social care services."

**Slide Page Title:** Design of CareCall Chatbot

**Bullet Points:**

* The CareCall chatbot is an open-ended dialog system powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) called HyperCLOVA.
* The LLM is trained on a Korean corpus of 561.8B tokens, including blog posts, online forums, news articles, comments, and online Q&As.
* The chatbot generates responses by inputting 20 relevant example dialogs and the current dialog history to the LLM.
* The example dialogs are sampled on the fly from a large-scale dialog corpus generated with a data augmentation technique.
* The example dialog corpus is inspected to ensure consistency with a specific agent persona and system policies.

**Speaker Notes:**

"So, let's take a closer look at the design of the CareCall chatbot. As you can see, it's an open-ended dialog system powered by a Large Language Model called HyperCLOVA. This LLM is trained on a massive corpus of 561.8 billion tokens, which includes a wide range of text data such as blog posts, online forums, news articles, comments, and online Q&As. When generating responses, the chatbot uses 20 relevant example dialogs and the current dialog history as input to the LLM. But what's interesting is that these example dialogs are not pre-defined, but rather sampled on the fly from a large-scale dialog corpus generated using a data augmentation technique. This ensures that the chatbot can respond in a more dynamic and flexible way. However, to ensure consistency with the desired agent persona and system policies, the example dialog corpus is carefully inspected and fine-tuned to avoid undesirable phrases or behaviors. This is particularly important for CareCall, as it's a phone-based chatbot that doesn't support many task-oriented dialogs like smart speakers do."

**Slide Page Title:** Limitations of the Study

**Bullet Points:**

* The study's findings may not generalize to other populations, such as older adults or people with dementia, due to differences in health and companionship needs.
* The study's context is specific to Seoul, and the deployment of CareCall in other municipalities may have different social care settings and monitoring goals.
* The study's sample size and demographics may not be representative of the target population, with a skew towards socially isolated males in their 50s and 60s.
* The study's participants may have had a positive attitude towards the chatbot due to their regular use of CareCall, which may not reflect the experiences of non-users or users who missed calls.
* The study's data collection methods may have introduced biases, such as overrepresentation of developers and underrepresentation of end-users.

**Speaker Notes:**

"Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining me today to discuss the limitations of our study. As we've discussed in previous slides, our study focused on the context of Seoul and the deployment of CareCall with low-SES middle-aged individuals living alone. However, we recognize that our findings may not be generalizable to other populations, such as older adults or people with dementia, due to differences in health and companionship needs.

Furthermore, our study's context is specific to Seoul, and the deployment of CareCall in other municipalities may have different social care settings and monitoring goals. This is an important consideration for future research and implementation of LLM-driven chatbots for public health interventions.

In addition, our study's sample size and demographics may not be representative of the target population, with a skew towards socially isolated males in their 50s and 60s. This may have impacted our findings, and we acknowledge that our results may not fully capture the lived experiences or concerns of end-users.

Finally, our data collection methods may have introduced biases, such as overrepresentation of developers and underrepresentation of end-users. We've made efforts to address these limitations through additional data collection methods, such as focus group observations, but we recognize that our results may not be comprehensive.

I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge these limitations and encourage future research to address these gaps in our understanding of LLM-driven chatbots for public health interventions."

**Slide Page Title:** "Benefits of Leveraging an LLM-driven Chatbot in Public Health Interventions"

**Short Bullet Points:**

* Teleoperators valued the holistic understanding of individuals gained through open-ended conversations with CareCall
* CareCall offloaded workload, allowing teleoperators to focus on high-priority cases
* Teleoperators gained rich contextual information about users' circumstances through CareCall conversations
* CareCall helped mitigate loneliness and emotional burdens for users
* Users looked forward to scheduled check-up calls and appreciated the emotional support provided by CareCall

**Speaker Notes:**

"Today, I'd like to highlight the benefits of leveraging an LLM-driven chatbot in public health interventions, specifically through the CareCall system. Our research shows that teleoperators valued the holistic understanding of individuals gained through open-ended conversations with CareCall, which allowed them to offload their workload and focus on high-priority cases. This was particularly important, as teleoperators reported that managing a large number of users would be mentally and physically exhausting without the support of CareCall.

CareCall's open-ended conversations also provided rich contextual information about users' circumstances, which helped teleoperators identify those who needed extra support. This was a significant advantage over rule-based dialog systems, which might not have captured the nuances of users' lives.

**Slide Page Title:** Challenges in Leveraging an LLM-driven Chatbot in Public Health Interventions

**Short Bullet Points:**

* Inherent challenges of LLMs in uncertainty in control
* Difficulty in controlling responses that might not be appropriate for public health contexts
* Challenges in tailoring the chatbot to public health needs
* Mismatches between municipalities' needs and LLM-driven chatbots' challenges

**Speaker Notes:**

"Good morning everyone, today we're going to discuss the challenges we faced in leveraging an LLM-driven chatbot, CareCall, in public health interventions. Despite its benefits, we encountered several challenges that hindered its effective use.

Firstly, the developers of CareCall struggled with the inherent uncertainty in control of LLMs. They found it difficult to control the responses generated by the system, which sometimes included suggestions that were not feasible or even impolite. This was particularly concerning given the vulnerability of the target population.

Another challenge we faced was tailoring the chatbot to public health needs. The municipalities had specific requirements, such as integrating dementia screening questionnaires, but the developers found it difficult to accommodate these requests due to the uncertainty in control of the system.

We also noticed mismatches between the municipalities' needs and the capabilities of LLM-driven chatbots. For instance, the developers could not guarantee that the system would ask specific health questions during calls, which was a requirement of the municipalities.

These challenges highlight the difficulties in leveraging LLM-driven chatbots in public health interventions. While they offer many benefits, they also require careful consideration and control to ensure their effective use in sensitive contexts."

Here is a suggested slide page title, bullet points, and speaker notes:

**Slide Title:** "Limitations of CareCall: Lack of Personalization and Emotional Support"

**Bullet Points:**

* CareCall's inability to generate personalized questions based on users' personal health history
* Users felt awkward when CareCall asked inappropriate questions without considering their current health status
* Lack of long-term memory made the system feel impersonal and robotic
* Repetition of general questions and responses across sessions limited emotional support
* Users felt like they were talking to a stranger despite months of engagement

**Speaker Notes:**

"Today, I'd like to highlight some of the limitations of the CareCall system. One of the key issues was its inability to generate personalized questions based on users' personal health history. This led to users feeling awkward when CareCall asked inappropriate questions without considering their current health status. For example, a user with liver cirrhosis involving ascites was asked if they had seen a doctor to remove fluid, despite having already discussed this with the teleoperator.

The lack of long-term memory in CareCall also made the system feel impersonal and robotic. Users felt like they were talking to a stranger despite months of engagement. The repetition of general questions and responses across sessions limited the emotional support that the system could provide. Users felt like they were just going through the motions, and the system didn't truly understand how they were doing.

This lack of personalization and emotional support led to a decrease in user motivation to engage in conversations with CareCall. Users felt like they could predict what the system would ask or say next, and therefore didn't feel invested in the conversations. This is a key area for improvement in the development of chatbots like CareCall."

"Today, we're going to discuss the challenges and opportunities in providing emotional support with LLM-driven chatbots. Our research highlights that technical difficulties in these systems hinder personalized responses and emotional support. Users want their conversations to consider their personal health history, but current systems lack long-term memory, making them feel impersonal and robotic. To address this, we need to implement long-term memory in LLM-driven chatbots. However, there are also concerns about AI technology replacing human social support and reducing human contact, which can have negative impacts on the health and wellbeing of individuals. Our study suggests that LLM-based chatbots have limitations in empathetic conversations and may convey biased perspectives. On the other hand, open-ended conversations with LLM-driven chatbots can mitigate loneliness and support diverse topics, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with limited conversation opportunities in their daily life. Future work should focus on designing LLM-driven chatbots to allow for immersive conversations around specific topics of users' interest to provide emotional support."

**Slide Page Title:** "Tensions between Supporting Informational and Emotional Needs in Public Health Chatbots"

**Bullet Points:**

* Open-domain chatbots in public health settings face challenges in supporting different stakeholders' needs due to their inherent characteristics.
* Expectation management around system capabilities is critical but challenging, particularly in public health settings.
* Interactions with open-domain chatbots may lead stakeholders to assume the chatbot can take on a maximal set of tasks, leading to disappointment when specific needs are not met.
* Technical advances in controlling open-domain chatbots could help address some challenges, but addressing larger problems requires understanding multiple stakeholders' needs.
* The choice of model puts informational and emotional support in tension with one another.
* Designing resources to communicate capabilities and limitations of chatbots and creating opportunities to hear multiple stakeholders' perspectives can help negotiate needs and design conversational prompts.

**Speaker Notes:**

"Today, I want to talk about the challenges of using open-domain chatbots in public health settings. Our study found that these chatbots face difficulties in supporting different stakeholders' needs due to their inherent characteristics, such as uncertainty in control and resource-intensive customization. Expectation management around system capabilities is critical but challenging, particularly in public health settings where stakeholders may have high expectations.

"When interacting with open-domain chatbots, stakeholders may assume the chatbot can take on a maximal set of tasks, leading to disappointment when specific needs are not met. For example, governments may assume the chatbot can provide emergency services, while users may assume it can provide care and support.

"While technical advances in controlling open-domain chatbots could help address some challenges, addressing larger problems requires understanding multiple stakeholders' needs. Our study suggests that the choice of model puts informational and emotional support in tension with one another.

"To address these challenges, we need to design resources that transparently communicate the capabilities and limitations of chatbots. We also need to create opportunities to hear multiple stakeholders' perspectives before developing or deploying a system for public health intervention. This will help developers better recognize what tensions might exist among different stakeholders and what misconceptions they might have toward the system, potentially benefiting the design of conversational prompts to avoid or prevent those."
